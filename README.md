Overview
------------

This is a digital MVP of the [Kanye West's $200 sten player](https://www.stemplayer.com/). The sten player is a physical product that allows users to play individual [stems](https://www.epidemicsound.com/blog/what-are-stems-in-music-production/) from a given song. I thought this was a fun concept, but not $200 fun, so I built my own.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Bootstrap
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter)

### Functionality
Currently any song in MP3 form can be uploaded to the stem player and split into four individual stems, allowing users to play, pause, and adjust the volume of individual stems to their liking.

### Future Improvements
- Improve the UI
- Host this damn thing

### Known Issues
- Spleeter uses too much memory, can cause crashes on <4gb RAM
